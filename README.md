<h1> About </h1>

---> Photograph

  <p1> I am a writer and filmmaker based in Berlin. I am particularly interested in the aesthetic and creative possibilities of using analogue film technology. To this end, I shoot super 8 and 16mm film alongside experimenting with alternative dark room processes. Since February 2016, I am an active member of LaborBerlin; an artist collective that seeks to explore and disseminate the practice of analogue filmmaking. </p1> 
  
  <p2> I hold a degree in Philosophy from the University of St Andrews, specialising in the areas of Aesthetics, Metaethics, and the Philosophy of Film. Some topics that I am interested in are: the question of authorship, differences between cinematic and literary narration, and cognitive film theory. </p2> 
  
  <p3> Finally, since making my own films, I have been concerned with the creative and financial difficulties of independent filmmaking. By documenting my own work, I hope to shine a light on alternative and more sustainable ways of production and distribution. </p3>
